## Introduction
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. The system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.
## Features
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid recommendation combining both collaborative and content-based filtering
- Interactive interface to get movie recommendations

## Technologies Used
- ython
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering algorithms)
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Numpy (for numerical computations)
